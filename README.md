# Solvy – AI-Powered Math Solver

**Solvy** is a Python-based AI tutor that provides **solutions** to arithmetic, algebra, and linear equation problems. Built as a learning assistant, Solvy helps users understand the reasoning behind each step — making it a great educational tool for school-level math learners.

This is my one of my major AI project, and it reflects my goal of combining **artificial intelligence** with **accessible education**.
